        <h2>DevOps ninja :)</h2>
        <p>I would love to design complex systems with high level of automation. I was always interested in how to
            create a CI/CD pipeline or how to manage a complex system with thousends of microservices in a cloud
            environment.
        </p>
        <p>Docker and Bash shell makes me fun :)</p>

            <h3>ALU</h3>
            <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
                operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
            <h3>ASCII</h3>
            <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers,
                so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
            <h3>RAM</h3>
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the
                general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the
                same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
            <h3>Programming Language</h3>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that
                implement specific algorithms.</p>
            <h3>DNS</h3>
            <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
                Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of
                the participating entities.</p>
            <h3>TCP</h3>
            <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the
                foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or
                transfer hypertext.</p>
